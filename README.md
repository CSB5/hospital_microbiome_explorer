Hospital Microbiome Explorer (beta)
------

## Description

This project provides a proof-of-concept 3D model to explore the hospital microbiome survey data associated with our manuscript ([Chng *et al*, 2020](#citation)). 

Note: currently the software includes partial data (2 rooms and 2 wards) and the full dataset will be added to the future releases.
  
## Installation

The compiled software is available at the [release page](https://github.com/lch14forever/hospital_microbiome_explorer/releases). The following platforms are supported:
 - WebGL application: Windows 7 or Windows 10, Firefox (52 or newer) or Google Chrome (57 or newer)
 - Windows executable: Windows 7 or Windows 10

## Usage

Start the application by double clicking index.html (WebGL) or HospitalMicrobiomeExplorer.exe (Windows executable).
  
Key binds:
 - W: Move forward
 - A: Move left
 - S: Move back
 - D: Move right
 - Mouse: Camera movement
 - Q: Toggle camera movement (mouse cursor released for selection)
 - Space: Toggle "Scene Switch" menu

Data exploration:
 - Click the glowing object to toggle the display for site scores and opportunistic pathogens detected at this site. 
 - Click the species name to toggle the display for strains detected at this site and the associated antibiotic resistance profile. 
 - Click the strain name to show the distribution of the strain across sites (highlighted in red) and rooms (highligted in orange on the right panel).
